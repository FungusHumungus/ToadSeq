# ToadSeq

ToadSeq is a small iOS library for generating and manipulating lazy sequences within Objective C.

Sequences can be derived from numerical sequences or arrays and other data structures. It's quite flexible. Transformations on the sequences are setup by chaining blocks. The transformations do not occur until the data is actually requested. Where possible the need to create arrays to store intermediate data is avoided.
